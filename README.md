* MATLAB - a lot of schools, especially engineering colleges, sponsor a university-wide MATLAB license, allowing you to save thousands upon thousands of dollars
* Microsoft Office - most schools sponsor free Microsoft Office for all of their students.
* Google Drive - if your school has an educational Google Apps account, you have infinite storage (technically like 10 TB) on your account. You can save everything to your heart's content on that account.
